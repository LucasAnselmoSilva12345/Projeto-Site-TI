# World Of Programming
  
This project is a website that presents about the 10 most used programming languages ​​in the world until December 2017.
  
This website was my first personal project, in which it was also a final work site for the conclusion of the 4th bimester of the technical course in computer science.

  
Although it is not a responsive site and seems to be sometimes repetitive in terms of structures, I got the award for *best project* presentation, so this project becomes very special to me.
